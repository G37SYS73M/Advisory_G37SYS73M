# Attack Vectors
> In this scenario there are two users where the user "superadmin" has all the permission to the application also the victim in this scenario and the user "admin1", the attacker in this scenario has only the permission to Create,Edit,Delete Employees and users.
> The vulnerability causes the use of a payload "<script>alert(141)</script>" by the user "admin1" to create an employee with the name as the payload. After creating the employee, a notification is raised when we login to the app as the "superadmin" user. Due to the lack of sanitization of the input the Javascript payload gets executed in the session of the "superadmin" user. This behavior can be replicated in any scenarios where the victim user receives a notification.
